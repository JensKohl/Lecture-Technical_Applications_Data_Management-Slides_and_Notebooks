Slides and notebooks from the lecture held at Fresenius University of Applied Sciences, Munich, Germany.

## Course Description
The lecture's name is a remainder from previous years and does not really cover the current topics and contents of the course...

The course is a 10-week long introduction into Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with focus on practical rather than theoretical knowledge.

Through tutorials, several programming assignments and a final project as group homework, the students learn to to code their own analyses and AI models via Python and Python Libraries Pandas, SciKit-Learn, Keras/ Tensorflow on Google Colabs.

Content currently in German.

Notebooks for the lecture uploaded, slides currently in revision, upload will follow.

Feedback most appreciated... :-)
